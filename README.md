# Cancer-Cell-Detection
This notebook consist of 2 pytoch models to classify cell images to 4 categories to identify cancer cells.
Model 1  is a custom Convolutional Neural Network model trained from scratch. Model 2 is a finetuned model using Resnet 101 pretrained model. Model interpretations to understand how different parts of the image contributes to the prediction are analysed in this notebook using Captum.
